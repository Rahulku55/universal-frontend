          receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact
          with us.
          For example, like many
          websites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses
          universalremedies.in or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of universalremedies.in on
          other Web sites. We may also receive/store information about your location and your mobile device, including a
          unique identifier for your device. We may use this information for internal analysis and to provide you with
          location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. </li>
        <li> <span class="fs-22 fw-700 mt-3">E-mail & SMS Communications: </span>
          To help
          us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from
          universalremedies.in if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists
          received from other companies in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do
          not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please send us email at info@universalremedies.in</li>
        <li> <span class="fs-22 fw-700 mt-3">Information from Other Sources:</span>
          We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. </li>

        processing, transferring and sharing information (including sensitive personal information) related to you with
        third parties or service providers for the purposes as set out in this Privacy Notice.
        <br><br>
        We may be required to share the aforesaid information with government authorities and agencies for the purposes
        of verification of identity or for prevention, detection or investigation, including of cyber incidents,
        prosecution and punishment of offences. You agree and consent for universalremedies.in to disclose your
        information, if so required, under applicable law.

      <ul>
        <li class="fs-20 fw-600 mt-3 text-muted">Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
          computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser and to provide
          features such as Recommended for You, personalised advertisements on other Web sites (e.g., Universal remedies
          Associates with content served by universalremedies.in) and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between
          visits. </li>

        <li class="fs-20 fw-600 mt-3 text-muted">You can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as

          cookies allow you to take advantage of some of universalremedies.in's essential features, we recommend that
          you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to
          add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any universalremedies.in products and services
          that require you to Sign in. </li>

      <h5 class="fw-600 fs-30">Does universalremedies.in share the Information it receives? </h5>
      <p class="fs-20 fw-600 mt-3">Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not
        in the business of selling it to others. universalremedies.in shares customer information only as described
        below and with universalremedies.in, Inc. and the subsidiaries which universalremedies.in, Inc., controls and
        that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in
        this Privacy Notice. </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="fs-20 fw-600 mt-3 text-muted">Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with
          affiliated
          businesses. In some cases, such as
          Marketplace our team, these businesses operate stores at universalremedies.in or sell offerings to you at
          universalremedies.in. In other cases, we provide services jointly with or on behalf of these businesses. Click
          here for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your
          transactions and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party. </li>

        <li class="fs-20 fw-600 mt-3 text-muted">Third Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and
          individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages,
          sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing
          marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing
          credit card payments and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to
          perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal
          information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable law. </li>
        <li class="fs-20 fw-600 mt-3 text-muted">Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of
          universalremedies.in customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business
          your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication
          Preferences.
        </li>
        <li class="fs-20 fw-600 mt-3 text-muted">
          Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or
          business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets
          but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer
          consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that universalremedies.in, Inc. or substantially all of its
          assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
        </li>
        <li class="fs-20 fw-600 mt-3 text-muted">
          Protection of universalremedies.in and Others: We release account and other personal information when we
          believe release is appropriate to comply with applicable law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other
          agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of universalremedies.in, our users or others. This
          includes exchanging information with other companies, organisations, government or regulatory authorities for
          fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting,
          sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in
          a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Notice
        </li>
        <li class="fs-20 fw-600 mt-3 text-muted">
          With your consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to
          third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="fw-600 fs-30">How Secure Is Information About Me? </h5>
      <ul>
        <li class="fs-20 fw-600 mt-3 text-muted">We work to protect the security of your information during transmission

          connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personal information (including sensitive personal
          information). Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we
          disclose personal information to you.
